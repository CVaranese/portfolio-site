## Overview
DeepTesla from MIT offers 10 videos of a Tesla Model S being driven on the highway, each with steering angle time stamped with each frame. The videos run at 30 FPS, which was sufficient for DeepTesla for being able to predict the steering angle from looking at a video stream using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Five of the datasets are with the Tesla autopilot driving and the latter half is with a human driver. DeepTesla was able to get good results with their CNN, but we wanted to see if we could improve the error by adding in recurrence in the form of a 3D CNN.

## 2D CNN with Saliency Maps
Our initial test 2D CNN performed much better than we expected, reaching an mse loss of around 1 after 2 epochs (which varied sometimes during training). The saliency maps show various things are picked up to determine the steering angle such as the lane lines, guard rails, and surprisingly enough-- the reflection of the vents!

## Nvidia Jetson TX2 on RC car
Personal video and steering angles were collected using a mechanical engineering senior project RC car. The goal was to take what was learned from the MIT deepTesla dataset and apply it to a real world control problem. Videos were obtained, but time only allowed for a study in saliency maps.

## Comments on Results
The project got off to a slow start because of all of the unforeseen difficulties. Initially, separating all of the data from videos into images took some time to figure out. After that, we learned that working with 19GB of images was not an easy task, so we had to preprocess our images by compressing/cropping before moving them around. Then, even when we preprocessed them, our Nvidia Jetson TX2 and the school servers could not load the entire dataset at once, so we took some time looking into methods of only partially loading the dataset, but we instead settled on just processing the images even more--compressing them to an npz file. The 3D CNN eventually required a generator to take random sequences of videos. The team had better results with 2D Convolution, despite the the inclusion of temporal information. The team would suggest looking into Transfer Learning as further research suggested better results with using a pre-trained model such as ResNet50.
